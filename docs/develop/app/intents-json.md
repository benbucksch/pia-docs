# Intents JSON

The intents JSON contains declarative description of your voice app, which functions it supports, what the user says to invoke them, which parameters they have, and the responses.

This information is used by Pia core to know what your application can do, when to invoke your application, and how. It also contains the translations of your app's input and output into various languages.

When you develop your application, this should be the first file that you write, before you start writing any code. But obviously after writing the README and TODO files. :-\) Likewise, it should be the first code file that a another developer reads when he starts to look at your application's code. It describes your app from an end user perspective.Pia source code

TODO Describe all sections in detail.

Please take a look at the examples in [Pia source code](https://github.com/benbucksch/pia/tree/master/app/), in `apps/*/intents.en.json`.
